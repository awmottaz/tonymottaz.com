Hi! I'm Tony. I am a front end web developer based in Minnesota.

This is my personal website. I write [blog posts](/blog) occasionally, and sometimes include some
other stuff, too.

## Colophon

I use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to write and build this website. It is deployed to [Render](https://render.com). This website has no tracking, analytics, cookies, or page view counting.

The source code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/awmottaz/tonymottaz.com).

The fonts you see on this site are [Haskoy](https://haskoy.ertekinn.com) and [Brutalist Mono](https://github.com/BRUTALISM/Brutalist).

The primary color scheme is based on [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki). Code blocks use the [a11y-dark theme by Eric Bailey](https://github.com/ericwbailey/a11y-syntax-highlighting).

## Site accessibility

I am committed to making this website accessible to anyone who wishes to view it. If you find any issues, please [email me](mailto:issues@tonymottaz.com) at **issues@tonymottaz.com**. I take these issues very seriously.
