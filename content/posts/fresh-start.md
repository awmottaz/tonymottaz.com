summary: "I am starting 2021 with a new look and feel to my website."

The turn of new year is a natural time to reflect. It is the end of one time,
and the beginning of a new one.

To mark the occasion, I set about giving my site a fresh coat of paint.

This new look is a symbol. Much like the new year, a new look to a website does
not mean much in itself. The updated appearance coincides with shift in focus
and goals for what my website is about.

In 2020, my website was a playground. It was a space for me to explore new tech
and build a site for the sake of building it. Nearly all the time I have
invested in this website has been invisible: writing code, iterating on design,
learning about design, exploring code hosting, and site hosting solutions, and
on and on.

Looking ahead to 2021, I want to shift my attention to the content that I
publish here. I want to improve my writing skills. I want to share the things
that I learn. I want to increase the value of my investment here.

More than that, this website should be a force for positivity in the world. I
want to learn how to write inclusively and demonstrate that to any readers I may
have. I want to build a welcoming space full of friendly and inviting content.
The internet is filled with too much negativity, disdain, and cynicism. My goal
is to do a small part to shift the needle in the other direction.

So, here's to the new year, and the perspective that it can offer. Here's to
building each other up and bringing smiles to each other's faces. Here's to
believing that the world is not all bad. That the web is not all bad. Here's to
believing in each other and walking through life in support of one another.
