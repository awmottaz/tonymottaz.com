## What I am up to now

### Rebuilding this website

Almost all of the time I've spent on this website has been in building it. And rebuilding it. And well, I'm at peace with that.

What's different this time around? First, [11ty version 2](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/). This static site generator is really a joy to work with.

Also, more markdown. I plan to write more about why I was avoiding it, and why I'm back onboard.

I also dropped my old content. As much as I believe in maintaining stable links on the web, I don't think anyone will mind. I do plan to rewrite some of those posts to be a better resource.
