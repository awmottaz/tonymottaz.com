title: About this website
---

Hi! I'm Tony. I am a front end web developer based in Minnesota.

This is my personal blog where I write about whatever I happen to be interested in. Maybe you
will find it interesting, too.

## How this site is built

I use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to write and build this website. It is deployed to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The source code can be found in [the Sourcehut repo](https://git.sr.ht/~tonymottaz/tonymottaz.com).

This website has zero tracking, analytics, cookies, page counting, logging, or analytics of any kind implemented by me. [Netlify Analytics](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/analytics/) are not enabled. I don't want to know anything about you.

## Site accessibility

I am committed to making this website accessible to anyone who wishes to view it. If you find any issues, please [email me](mailto:issues@tonymottaz.com) at **issues@tonymottaz.com**. I take these issues very seriously.
