Hi! I'm Tony. I am a front end web developer based in Minnesota.

This is my personal blog where I write about whatever I happen to be interested in. Maybe you
will find it interesting, too.

## How this site is built

I use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to write and build this website. It is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The source code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/awmottaz/tonymottaz.com).

This website has no tracking, analytics, cookies, or page view counting. Vercel provides me with [runtime server logs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/runtime-logs). As far as I can tell, there is no identifying information available in those logs, and I can only see the most recent hour of logs. I almost never look at them anyway â€” I don't want to know anything about you.

## Site accessibility

I am committed to making this website accessible to anyone who wishes to view it. If you find any issues, please [email me](mailto:issues@tonymottaz.com) at **issues@tonymottaz.com**. I take these issues very seriously.
